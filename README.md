# 🏀 Balls
My first small project, that was made with the help of the first Usov's book at the beginning of my studies.

There are 4 balls in a row on the screen and it is possible to move them. The effect is also implemented, as if the ball is spinning on a rope, if you try to move it quickly (snapBehavior).
